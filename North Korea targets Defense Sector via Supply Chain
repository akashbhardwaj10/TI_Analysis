üá∞üáµ North Korea targets Defense Sector via Supply Chain

Lazarus infiltrated a Website Maintance and Repair Supplier of a Maritime Research organization to drop #NukeSped via patch management systems (PMS) to steal trade secrets. After infiltrating the supplier, they accessed the targets web server via stolen SSH keys.

Once on the webserver, Lazarus uses curl to retrieve tools from the C2 server: ngrok and a base-64 encoded Python downloader script.

Lazarus used SSH to move laterally throughout the network using TCP Dump to collect network data and stole account credentials from employees.

Lazarus accessed the Security Managers mailbox using stolen account credentials to understand the PMS procedure and request a new patch for deployment via the PMS Service Provider.

The patch masqueraded as a legitimate file and had functions to upload and download files, execute code, and to collect system information.

The file was called: ‚ÄúEncryptModule_Patch.exe‚Äù and is the #NukeSped RAT used by Lazarus.

The Security Manager identified the malicious activity and stopped the deployment of NukeSped malware.

‚õî Key Findings
---------------------
Legacy remote working due to COVID lead to lacking security controls, allowing unattended access to servers.

Lazarus persisted via alternative methods e.g. webshells and took advantage of a trusted relationship between target and supplier.
