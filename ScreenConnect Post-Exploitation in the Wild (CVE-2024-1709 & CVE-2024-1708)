Starting from February 19, Huntress has been disseminating technical information regarding the ScreenConnect vulnerability dubbed as "SlashAndGrab." Previously, we disclosed comprehensive details about the vulnerability itself, its exploitation, and provided guidance on detection.

In this piece, we've assembled and refined insights into threat actor activities recently observed within the Huntress Security Operations Center (SOC). Our team has identified and thwarted active adversaries who are exploiting ScreenConnect access for post-exploitation tactics. The adversaries exploiting this vulnerability have been exceptionally active.

Following the remarkable collaborative international efforts to dismantle the LockBit ransomware group, many are questioning the continued relevance of "LockBit." The LockBit deployments we've encountered involve an encryptor that seems to have been compiled around September 13, 2022—coinciding with the timeline of the previously leaked LockBit 3.0 builder. One observed filename is the classic LB3.exe, which aligns with the well-known and publicly leaked builder.

This distinction is crucial. While the deployed malware appears linked to LockBit, there is no evidence to suggest that the joint international takedown efforts are anything less than a significant milestone in disrupting one of the world's largest and most active ransomware groups. It is observed other ransomware attempts, like upd.exe and svchost.exe, that Microsoft Defender consistently neutralized. Also observed adversaries leverage certutil downloaded ransomware .MSI payloads, which they also made persistent via startup folders.

There was a particular adversary, using 185.62.58[.]132, executing a script on compromised systems across multiple unique victim networks. The intent of the script was to identify which of their compromised systems with the highest privileges. This demonstrates the scale with which threat actors are abusing this vulnerability as they are working to automate their understanding of where to take additional, post-compromise actions moving forward.

Somewhat disappointing for a lack of originality, a significant number of adversaries used their ScreenConnect access to deploy cryptocurrency coin miners. There was a particularly entertaining attempt to masquerade a coinminer as a legitimate SentinelOne file. Adversaries seemed to commonly install additional, “legitimate” remote access tools, likely as an attempt to remain persistent even once the ScreenConnect fiasco has been cleared up. 

= = We observed the Simple Help RMM agent deployed in the following directories: = =
1. C:\\Users\\oldadmin\\Documents\\Maxx Uptime remote connection\\Files\\agent.exe\
2. C:\\ProgramData\\JWrapper-Remote Access\\JWAppsSharedConfig\\restricted\\SimpleService.exe
3. C:\\Users\\oldadmin\\Documents\\MilsoftConnect\\Files\\ta.exe
4. C:\Windows\spsrv.exe

It is also observed a configuration file dropped to C:\\ProgramData\\JWrapper-Remote Access\\JWAppsSharedConfig\\serviceconfig.xml, which revealed it was configured to communicate to the public IPv4 91.92.240[.]71. The user oldadmin was observed being used running similar commands across multiple unique victim organizations.
